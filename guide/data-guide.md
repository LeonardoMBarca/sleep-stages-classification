# Base Information for Data Comprehension

## Electroencephalogram (EEG) ðŸ§ 
An **electroencephalogram (EEG)** works by placing electrodes on a patient's scalp to capture the electrical activity generated by the brain's neurons. A machine amplifies and records this activity, creating a graph (or tracing) that a doctor interprets to diagnose and monitor neurological conditions. This is done by identifying different "brain waves" that indicate the patient's state of attention, relaxation, or **sleep**.

### What It Is and How It's Done
* **Electrical Activity of the Brain**: The brain functions through electrical impulses created by communication between nerve cells (neurons).
* **Electrodes**: The EEG is a non-invasive exam that applies small sensors (electrodes) to the patient's scalp. 
* **Capture and Amplification**: These electrodes pick up the brain's spontaneous electrical activity and send it to a specific device.
* **Graphical Record**: The equipment amplifies the electrical signals and converts them into a graph, showing the brain waves that represent brain activity.
* The EEG assesses different brain states, such as wakefulness (attention), relaxation, drowsiness, and deep sleep, through brain wave patterns.
* In this case, it is divided into 2 channels:
    * **EEG Fpz-Cz**: This is a referential channel, measuring the electrical activity at the **Fpz electrode** (mid-frontal, near the forehead) minus that of the **Cz electrode** (central, top of the head). The result is a signal representing the **frontal/anterior activity** of the brain.
    * **EEG Pz-Oz**: This is also a referential channel, measuring the activity at the **Pz electrode** (mid-parietal, behind the top of the head) minus the **Oz electrode** (mid-occipital, back of the head). The result is a signal representing the **posterior activity** of the brain, particularly regions linked to vision and sensory integration.

## Horizontal Electrooculogram (EOG) ðŸ‘€
A **horizontal electrooculogram (EOG)** works by measuring the electrical potential difference between the eyes, which is generated by the retinal pigment epitheliumâ€”a key cell layer for vision. Electrodes are placed on the forehead and at the corners of the eyes to capture this activity while the patient follows light points that change position. This helps assess the function of the pigment epithelium under different lighting conditions. The analysis of this voltage variation, known as the **Arden ratio**, can detect changes indicating retinal dystrophies or other ocular issues.

### What It Is and How It's Done
* **Activation**: Two phases are applied: a **dark phase**, where the patient adapts to a darkened dome, and a **light phase**, where the dome is lit, and the patient follows light stimuli with horizontal eye movements.
* **Recording**: During these eye movements, the electrodes record the electrical signals, generating the horizontal EOG.
* **Analysis**: The variation in electrical voltage (amplitude) is analyzed by comparing the peak of the light phase with the trough of the dark phase. This ratio is the **Arden ratio**, used to evaluate the functional state of the retinal pigment epithelium.
* **What the Exam Measures**: It measures the response of the retinal pigment epithelium to changes in light intensity, indicating the health and function of this crucial cell layer for vision.

## Submental Electromyogram (EMG) ðŸ’ª
The **submental electromyogram (EMG)** works by inserting a needle electrode into the submental muscle (under the chin) to record its electrical activity. This allows a doctor to assess the health of the muscle and the nerves that control it. It detects abnormal electrical patterns at rest and during contraction, helping to diagnose muscle problems, nerve issues, or neuromuscular junction disorders in the face and neck region.

### What It Is and How It's Done
* **Needle Electrode Insertion**: A fine needle is introduced into the submental muscle, which is responsible for movements like elevating the tongue and the floor of the mouth.
* **Recording of Electrical Activity**: The needle records the muscle's electrical activity in two states:
    * **Rest**: To check for any abnormal electrical activity when the muscle is relaxed.
    * **Voluntary Contraction**: The patient is asked to contract the muscle, and the electrical activity is recorded during this effort.

## Wave Types in EEG
The EEG records electrical fluctuations in the brain. These fluctuations appear as rhythms that can be separated by frequency (measured in Hz, or cycles per second). These are called **frequency bands**. 

### Frequency Ranges (Classic Standard)
* **Delta (0.5 - 4 Hz)**: Slow, large waves associated with **deep sleep (N3)**. Indicates physiological restoration. ðŸ˜´
* **Theta (4-8 Hz)**: Intermediate frequency, predominant in **light sleep (N1 and N2)**. Related to drowsiness and diffuse attention.
* **Alpha (8-12 Hz)**: A relaxed rhythm that appears when we are awake with our **eyes closed**. It disappears when we open our eyes or fall asleep, making it a key marker for the wake-to-sleep transition.
* **Sigma (12-16 Hz)**: Marks **sleep spindles**, which are characteristic of the N2 sleep stage. They are involved in memory consolidation and protecting sleep from disruptions.
* **Beta (16-30 Hz)**: Fast activity that appears during **active wakefulness** (e.g., attention, reasoning). It can also increase during REM sleep. ðŸ¤”

## Power Metrics ðŸ“Š
These metrics help quantify the characteristics of the EEG signal within the different frequency bands.

### What is `pow`?
* `pow` stands for **absolute spectral power**.
* It measures the total amount of energy of the signal within a specific frequency band.
* It's typically calculated using a Power Spectral Density (PSD) estimation, often with methods like Welch's.
* **Example**: `EEG_Fpz_Cz_delta_pow` represents the absolute energy of the EEG Fpz-Cz signal found in the delta band (0.5-4 Hz).
* It answers the question: "In absolute terms, how much of the signal is concentrated in this frequency band?"

### What is `relpow`?
* `relpow` stands for **relative power**.
* This is the fraction of the total EEG signal's energy that belongs to a specific band.
* **Example**: `EEG_Fpz_Cz_theta_relpow` = 0.15. This means that **15%** of the total energy in that EEG channel is in the Theta band.
* This metric is excellent because it normalizes the data, eliminating variations in absolute signal amplitude between subjects and allowing for fairer comparisons.

### What is `logpow`?
* `logpow` is the **logarithm of the absolute power**.
* It's used because power distributions are often highly skewed (with a few very large values and many small ones).
* Applying a logarithm transforms the data to be closer to a normal (bell-shaped) distribution, which is very helpful for statistical analysis and machine learning models.

### What is `peakfreq`?
* `peakfreq` stands for **peak frequency**.
* It identifies the frequency at which the **maximum power peak** occurs within a given band.
* **Example**: If the strongest peak within the alpha band is at 10.5 Hz, then the `alpha_peakfreq` would be 10.5.
* This is useful for studying individual differences, as some people may have a naturally "slower" or "faster" alpha rhythm.
